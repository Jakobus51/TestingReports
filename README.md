# TestingReports
Small winforms application to create reports of back end unit tests and front end testcafe tests.

Back-end UNit tests:
If you run the unit tests in the VSF development environment, a .xml will be created in folder ("C:\Users\xxx\source\Workspaces\Alea Forecaster\Unit Tests 2\bin\Debug\net5.0-windows\Results").
You can use this file to make a report of your unit tests. Just plug the file into the application and you're done.

Front-end testcafe tests:
The same can be done with testcafe tests. Export it as a JSON and plug it into the application.
